# UC Berkeley EECS149 Fire Detection Drone Project

The UC Berkeley EECS149 Fire Detection Drone Project is a Clone of the Ardupilot Project. If you are looking for the original ArduPilot project, this is probably not what you are looking for! 

Thank you to the ArduPilot development community for creating an easy to use base platform for this class project. Our project builds on the original ArduPilot program with additional code to help it detect and find fires.
